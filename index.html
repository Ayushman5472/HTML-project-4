                Hi Everyone, I am Ayushman. I am 13 years old and I live in Gurgaon. I love Origami and as a child I used to make it every single day after coming from school. I still like making nice stuff out of paper. I even use many of my creations in daily life.  </p>

                    Things I made that help me
                </h2>     
                <p>
            
        Phone stand - This was a very easy thing to make and it only took me around 30 mins. This is a very useful product and can be used as a mount for your phone. I use it to watch some videos while i work on something else as i don't need to hold my phone.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Pencil stand - This was not that tough but not easy too. It took me around 1 hour to make this. However, my hard work paid off and now it is very useful for me. I use it to store pencils and pens that i frequently use so that i have all of them in one place so I can take them whenever i need them.
